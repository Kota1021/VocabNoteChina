  <a>With this application, you can add notes to new words you learn while studying Chinese. Instead of simply memorizing the contents of a book, students can further strengthen their memory by thinking of sentences that use the words and thinking of their own translations.
With 11092 words in the entire HSK 1-9 range, this book can be used by beginners who have just begun learning Chinese, intermediate learners who want to strengthen their vocabulary, and advanced learners who want to take their Chinese language skills to the next level. It is also perfect for those who are going to study abroad in China.
The app has been thoughtfully designed to eliminate distractions so you can learn Chinese comfortably. The app supports a dark mode that is easy on the eyes, so you can study even at night when you can't sleep because your mind is so sharp.
One of the biggest problems in learning a foreign language is not being able to clearly see how much progress you have made. The multiple graphs in this app visualize your efforts and growth beautifully. This will keep you motivated so that you can continue to study Chinese in an enjoyable way.
Confucius said, "A person who understands a thing is no match for a person who likes it. A person who likes a thing is no match for a person who enjoys it.
Let's enjoy and master the study of Chinese.</a>
